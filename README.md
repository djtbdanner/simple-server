Simple node server.

No dependencies or other BS - this is just run by Node server.js.

Has cors, file serving, sets content type, etc. 

Could easily be used to build a web site... the files in public, if no server interaction, could be deployed to a static site (e.g. s3).

Start up is fast, it just works.
